        I’m a frontend-focused full stack developer with nearly 3 years of
        professional experience. I specialize in building responsive,
        high-performance web applications using React.js and Next.js.
        <br /><br />
        I enjoy crafting clean UI, writing maintainable code, and working on
        real-time systems involving WebSockets and APIs. I’ve worked on live
        sports streaming platforms, OTT applications, and real-time
        communication systems.
